uint16[72] distances # Distance of obstacles around the UAV with index 0 corresponding to local North. A value of 0 means that the obstacle is right in front of the sensor. A value of max_distance +1 means no obstacle is present. A value of UINT16_MAX for unknown/not used. In a array element, one unit corresponds to 1cm.

uint8 increment # Angular width in degrees of each array element.

uint16 min_distance # Minimum distance the sensor can measure in centimeters.
uint16 max_distance # Maximum distance the sensor can measure in centimeters.
